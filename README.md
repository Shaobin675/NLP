# NLP
The Dataset is based on NLTK movie review package without the 'stopwords'. And then with 7 classifiers, we can generate a 'vote classifier' which means this classifier is the most effective and steady one. Search a certain word to find the twitter including it, and then classify the twitter, finally we draw a live chart to present how people think of this word.
